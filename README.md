# Firebase Debug Arena - Frontend

This firebase refactor is based on [The Debug Arena's implementation of firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jOq6SXBF-k)

It includes the use of [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) which is the NoSQL Database that can be added to Firebase projects.

Here is the [original REPO](https://github.com/the-debug-arena/Login-Auth-Firebase-ReactJS). The original project was created using `create-react-app` toolchain instead of `vite`

This refactor uses `vite`
