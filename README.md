# Firebase Debug Arena - Frontend

This is a client side login for Firebase. It includes the [login with email and password](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth) functionality and the [sign in with Google functionaility](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin) from Firebase.

This firebase refactor and scaffold is based on [The Debug Arena's implementation of firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jOq6SXBF-k)

It includes the use of [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) which is the NoSQL Database that can be added to Firebase projects.

Here is the [original REPO](https://github.com/the-debug-arena/Login-Auth-Firebase-ReactJS). The original project was created using `create-react-app` toolchain instead of `vite`

This refactor uses `vite`
